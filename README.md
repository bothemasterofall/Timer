# Timer
Basic timer object for C++. Can take multiple snapshots of time and compare diffs between each.

## Why does this exist?
This class and its example usage more or less illustrates how I enjoy tracking time in my own
programs. I simply became tired of rewriting these methods so I created an object to do it for
me.

## Do you know Boost exists?
I just wanted something simple that could show me time in clock ticks or seconds between a few
points in my program.
